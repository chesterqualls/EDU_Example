# EDU Research Example
To share a project, get help and inspiration, and maybe help someone else:
<br>This repository will display Jupyter Notebooks created to describe the data found in CSV files for a research project,
clean those files for use in research, and infer information about the data.
Some of the information was anonymized from the source and I've taken some steps to further anonymize the data so I can share.
<br><br>
This project came to me as 7 CSV files for the treatment group, and 7 CSV files for the comparison group. There was no codebook. So the steps taken were...<br>
1. Create a codebook for each file, this included some descriptive statistics (so far I only have the Enrollment file).
2. Once the data is understood begin to clean the data so it can be used.
3. Create some more in-depth descriptive statistics from the cleaned data.
4. Create some inferred statistics (not yet shown).

* When I first started to work on this project I thought I should do the work in R since I had an example to go off.  I had the idea of doing it different though so I began to work on that. Also SQL provided a comfort zone for me and I was glad to find the **sqldf** library.  I like that still. Anyway I'm including the R scripts I created, they aren't fully developed.
