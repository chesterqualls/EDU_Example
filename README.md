To share a project, get help and inspiration, and maybe help someone else
This repository will display Jupyter Notebooks created to describe the data found in CSV files for a research project,
clean those files for use in research, and infer information about the data.
Some of the information was anonymized from the source and I've taken some steps to further anonymize the data so I can share.
